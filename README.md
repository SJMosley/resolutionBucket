# Resolution Bucket
New years resolutions give you one large thing to strive for, many don't get achieved. If you do achieve your goal, then what? Whats next? With bucket list resolutions you set (approximately) 30 goals. Then shoot for a mere 10% of your goals (round up). If you finish 10%, keep going! The amount you can get done in a year is shocking.

            high level goal</a> that most of these help achieve.
        </li>
        <li> Make goals that are ambitious, even if you complete only 10% you should be proud.</li>
        <li> Make goals that are measurable and have clear end states (i.e. "run a marathon" or "read 15 books").</li>
        <li> Repeating goals are extremely difficult to achieve, use them sparingly (i.e. "do this every day/week").</li>
        <li> A key part of bucket list resolutions is being able to look back and see all you have done.</li>
        <li> Don't be too distraught if your goals change completely throughout the year. Life happens, reflect on what you did do and set new goals for the next.</li>
      </ul>

Ray Batts told me about his resolution bucket list back in 2013 at a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GameDevDrinkUp">GameDevDrinkUp</a>
        , I have been doing it ever since. It helps me look back and see how I have changed and grown, and what I have achieved.

Located at http://resolutionbucket.fallfaster.com, Hosted with <a href="https://www.meteor.com/hosting">Galaxy</a>. I will be leaving it up until January 31st. Taking it down after because I don't want to pay for hosting it.

Feel free to use any of the code or host your own implementation. There is a lot that could be added to this and I may eventually move the hosting to a tiny server of my own so that I can keep it up for good and add email reminders of goals.
